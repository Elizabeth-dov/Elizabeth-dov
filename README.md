## Hi there 👋

## My name is **Elizabeth Dovhaliuk** ✨

I am a beginner web developer. I started actively learning about web development a year ago, using resources on the Internet, in particular, the Codecademy and Udemy platforms. During this time I gained knowledge and skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. My next step will be to study full stack web development. 👩🏼
