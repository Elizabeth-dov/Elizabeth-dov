## My name is **Elizabeth** ✨

I am 23 years old and currently I am in my final semester of my master's degree in political science. Additionally, I am an aspiring iOS developer with a background in front-end web development. I have been actively learning programming through various online resources such as YouTube, Codecademy, Udemy, and Roadmap. Recently, I shifted my focus to iOS development, studying Swift and SwiftUI to build intuitive and user-friendly applications. My goal is to gain hands-on experience and further deepen my understanding of mobile development. 🚀 👩🏼
